# Preliminary Designs

## Design 1
The first design is 4 wheel drive where all 4 wheel drives are powered with motor. It uses four dc motors two on front wheels and other two on rear wheels.
This will make the device to reduce the overall mowing time of the lawn. The first design of blade is static which is not powered electrically.
It is fixed on the sides and another blade on the base of the device which is electrically powered.

## Design 2
The second design is three wheel drive where the rear wheel is powered with the help of dc motor which helps to keep down the overall weight of the device and blade is attached at the front of the device. Main parts of the device are pivot shaft, spur gear and motor bracket. The second design of the blade is the conventional roller blade which is often used in the manual lawn mower.

## Design 3
The third design is inspired from the shopping cart where force is only applied at the rear wheels. Following the same mechanism this design has two wheel drive which means it has
only two powered wheels which makes the device move and two non-powered wheels which are attached to the device and has circular base of light material which keeps the overall weight of the device down and battery requirement less. The blade preliminary design is simple and has sharp edges.

## Selection of Design
After preliminary designs, we set a criteria to choose one of the design

• Obtainability of parts – 40%

• Cost – 10%

• Complexity – 15%

• Size – 15%

• Power – 15%

• Precision – 10 %

Obtainability of parts factor clenches the highest importance due to the designing and fabrication of the device.

## Theory
Designing Consideration takes into account the following

o Cutting Force

o Blade torque

o Power requirement of motor

o Velocity of Machine

Motor to move the machine is based on number of revolutions per speed. High torque will be needed to sufficiently power the power.

## Mathematical Calculations

We assumed coefficient of friction to be 0.1 used in general case of cutting grass, and weight of blade and rpm.

## Structural Analysis
Structural analysis comprises the set of physical rules and mathematics required to study and
predicts the behaviour of structures. The subjects of structural analysis are engineering artefacts
whose integrity is judged largely based upon their ability to withstand loads; they commonly
include buildings, bridges, aircraft, and ships. Structural analysis incorporates the fields of mechanics and dynamics as well as the many failure theories. From a theoretical perspective
the primary goal of structural analysis is the computation of deformations, internal forces, and
stresses. Structural analysis can be seen more theoretically as a process to drive the engineering
design process or verify the soundness of a design without a need of directly testing it.
