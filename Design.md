# Preliminary Designs

## Design 1
The first design is 4 wheel drive where all 4 wheel drives are powered with motor. It uses four dc motors two on front wheels and other two on rear wheels.
This will make the device to reduce the overall mowing time of the lawn. The first design of blade is static which is not powered electrically.
It is fixed on the sides and another blade on the base of the device which is electrically powered.

## Design 2
The second design is three wheel drive where the rear wheel is powered with the help of dc motor which helps to keep down the overall weight of the device and blade is attached at the front of the device. Main parts of the device are pivot shaft, spur gear and motor bracket. The second design of the blade is the conventional roller blade which is often used in the manual lawn mower.

## Design 3
The third design is inspired from the shopping cart where force is only applied at the rear wheels. Following the same mechanism this design has two wheel drive which means it has
only two powered wheels which makes the device move and two non-powered wheels which are attached to the device and has circular base of light material which keeps the overall weight of the device down and battery requirement less. The blade preliminary design is simple and has sharp edges.

## Selection of Design
After preliminary designs, we set a criteria to choose one of the design

• Obtainability of parts – 40%

• Cost – 10%

• Complexity – 15%

• Size – 15%

• Power – 15%

• Precision – 10 %

Obtainability of parts factor clenches the highest importance due to the designing and fabrication of the device.
