# CapstoneProjectLawnMower
A robotic lawn mower that is self-guided without a need for human directional control.

# Purpose
The purpose of creating an autonomous lawn mower is to create a better system for robotic lawn mowers. In todayâ€™s market, there are only lawn mowers that turn at random to cover the area, our design will minimize time spent mowing, energy used. The designed system will be an autonomous lawn mower built using a standard self-propelled lawn mower as its base. The system should have the ability to mow a square section of grass measuring 20 feet by 20 feet in the approximate time a human could mow the same section.
This concept of operations will focus on the mowers requirements and its ability to fulfil the desired outcome.
